		"abstract": "Globally, tourism is the most developed economic sector, its strong influence surpassing established economic sectors such as the automotive industry or the agri-food sector.\n\nThe fantastic potential to stimulate the development of other economic branches (constructions, food sector, transport industry), as well as the influence it exerts on the gross domestic product of countries like Spain, Greece, San Marino, make the tourism sector an economic and social phenomenon. In the context of an accelerated expansion of the tourism industry worldwide, which increases the number of those involved in tourism, there is a need to create a system to maintain the quality of tourism services and improve services offered to tourists.\n\nThis paper aims to analyze the importance of applying the principles of quality management in tourism services through sociological research methods.",
